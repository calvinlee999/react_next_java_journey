# React → Next.js → Java Journey 🚀

A comprehensive learning journey from frontend React development to full-stack Next.js applications and backend Java development.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This repository provides a structured path to master modern web development:

1. **React Fundamentals** - Build solid frontend skills
2. **Next.js Full-Stack** - Learn modern React framework with SSR/SSG
3. **Java Backend** - Develop robust server-side applications
4. **Integration** - Connect frontend and backend technologies

## 📚 Journey Structure

### Phase 1: React Basics (Frontend Foundation)
- **Duration**: 2-3 weeks
- **Focus**: Component-based UI development
- **Technologies**: React, JavaScript ES6+, HTML5, CSS3

### Phase 2: Next.js Intermediate (Full-Stack Framework)
- **Duration**: 3-4 weeks  
- **Focus**: Server-side rendering, routing, and API development
- **Technologies**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, API Routes

### Phase 3: Java Backend (Server Development)
- **Duration**: 4-5 weeks
- **Focus**: RESTful APIs, databases, and enterprise patterns
- **Technologies**: Java, Spring Boot, JPA/Hibernate, PostgreSQL

### Phase 4: Integration (Full-Stack Application)
- **Duration**: 2-3 weeks
- **Focus**: Connecting frontend and backend
- **Technologies**: All of the above + deployment strategies

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Java 17+ and Maven
- Git
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)
- PostgreSQL (for backend phase)
